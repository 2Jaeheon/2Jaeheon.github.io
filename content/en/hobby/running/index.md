For me, running is more than just exercise, it gives me a sense of just being me.

I love the feeling of clearing my head, emptying my mind, and being able to just be me without any thoughts.
It's my biggest stress reliever, especially on stressful days. At first, I found it very difficult to run even 1-3 kilometers, but now I'm able to run longer distances. The process of setting a goal and pushing myself to achieve it gives me joy like nothing else.

I also enjoy spending time with nature through running. Unlike in the city, running along paths along rivers and in parks allows me to soak up the fresh air and see natural landscapes I wouldn't normally see. These experiences are memories that I will cherish forever, which is why running is such a valuable hobby that makes me a better person.
